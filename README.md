**Main Objectives**

There are a few objectives that will be achieved through the completion of this study. Primarily what this research study is trying to achieve is implementing a troubleshooting system that will solve windows operating system related issues using artificial intelligence and machine learning which will successfully provide the solution to regular user and industry level troubleshooting issues. In order to achieve the primary objective, each member will be carried out 4 different specific sub-studies which each one will cover specific troubleshooting area of the study. And the secondary objectives are to carry out the research according to a pre-planned out the timeline and complete according to a decided deadline.

The main objective of this study is to create a more efficient and reliable AI-based smart troubleshooting assistant program for Windows OS. This troubleshooting system is going to be developed so that it can solve window operating system issues of both industry level and regular users. In order to achieve this main objective, this main study has divided into 4 subcategories of troubleshooting which will carry out as 4 separate studies by the members of the research group.

This study is planned to be carried out according to the planned time frame according to several milestones which consist of specific sub deadlines for each step of the study. The pre-mentioned specific milestones of this study well planned and realistically achievable throughout the give grant chart in the appendix because it will be planned and carried out through the team effort of the 4-member research group under the supervision of the study supervisor.

**Individual Objectives**

This study will be divided in to 4 specific sub objectives which will be carry out the separate by the research team members. Each of those sub objectives is an essential aspect of the project which are specifically designed to achieve a specific part of the troubleshooting field of Windows OS. Those sub objectives are the main components in the software architecture. Those troubleshooting components are,
1. Determine the optimum solution to sort out application (pre-selected) related issues.
2. Troubleshoot abundant services specific issues.
3. Troubleshoot fundamental OS specific issues.
4. Perform environment setup by analyzing software.

**Troubleshoot application related issues**

This sub objective handle how to solve pre-selected applications errors using OS troubleshooter. So, it essentially handles the part of getting the issue from the user and identifying the issue then use the knowledge base to create a solution for the issue. Following are the objectives that have to be completed in order to have the full functionality of this component.

• Identify common symposium and problem related with pre-selected application.
• User can easily fixed issue when running the applications.
• At minimum, SAITA will be able to help them narrow down the problem by executing the solution.
• This technique which can resolve the problem so one can continue working without any problems.

**Troubleshoot abundant services specific issues**

This subcomponent is responsible for handling Windows service specific issues. Its primary task is to track down the service hierarchy of a Windows service based on the information provided by the user and give an acceptable solution to the user by safely configuring Windows service registry. Following are the objectives that have to be completed in order to have the full functionality of this component.
• Implement a method to identify the users’ issue through the chat platform.
• Solve service specific issues by first designing a method to identify services (In the windows service registry) with issues and get their service hierarchy because adjusting one service can affect many other services.
• So, in order to repair one service other interconnected services should be configured first. If it wasn’t done without configuring connected services, solution could be ineffective.
• Developing a Machine Learning based method to determine the most appropriate route of repairing the service by using models which were trained before.
• Markov decision making technique is suggested to be used. Edit the registry to fix the issues by implementing a function to edit registry.

**Troubleshoot fundamental OS specific issues**

The main purpose of this specific objective is to implement a troubleshooting module that will solve fundamental Windows operating system specific issues. So, it gets the problem of the user and categorize it then generate a technical or non-technical solution. In order to develop a system which, enable the user to effectively interact and perform computer troubleshooting effectively following objectives will be achieved,
• Store the necessary data for the system to work in a suitable way using a suitable method.
• Implement a Decision-making process for identifying the windows issue using suitable machine learning algorithms.
• Design a method to create solution scripts using the data from the database.
• Using NLG algorithm to create sentences using keywords from the database.
• Training Machine Leaning models.
• Test the performance of the system for the expected outcomes.

**Perform environment setup by analyzing software**

This is the objective that responsible for developing a method to perform pre-installation tasks and create a best environment for the application to by handling dependencies. So essentially this is a sub objective that handles the troubleshooting of installation issues. For that below sub objectives should be implemented in the system,
• Get Software list from user using chat platform.
• Analyze dependences, system paths and registry.
• Create hierarchy for installation process.
• Handling pre-installation requirement.
• Execute setup software with minimum risk and minimum user in involvement.
• Handling post installation requirement.
